# scala-mas

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ParaPhraseAGH/scala-mas.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ParaPhraseAGH/scala-mas)

A Lightweight parallel Multi-Agent System library in Scala.

## Instalation

Scala-mas will be available on Maven Central soon.

For now, you need to checkout the repository and build the code with Sbt.

## Structure

The project is structures into the following modules:

- **mas**- APIs for designing a MAS, as well as two execution backends: a synchronous and asynchronous one.
- **emas** - A example MAS application for evolutionary optimization.
- **genetic** - Genetic operators' APIs for evolutionary optimization.
- **stats** - utilities for gathering statistics from your MAS application

## Getting started

Scala-mas main use case is to create efficient Evolutionary Multi-Agent Systems, a meta-heuristic algorithm used for optimization.

## Usage

### Evolutionary Multi-Agent Systems

#### Running a simulation

#### Writing custom genetic operators

### Custom Multi-Agent Systems

#### Agent API

#### Backends
